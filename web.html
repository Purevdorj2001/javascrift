     <p>HyperText Markup Language</p>
    </div> 
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup 
        language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
        browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading
        e Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

        <p2>HTML's history</p>
 </div>
    <p2>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN,
      proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers 
     to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing 
     an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
      That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the
      project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext 
     is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p2>
